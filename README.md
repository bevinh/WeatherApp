# WeatherApp
Really simple weather app made with react-native

To use this app you'll need react-native, and an account with Weather Underground to use their API.

You'll want to make a config file with that account information that looks like this:

const config = {
    apiKey: 'put your api key here'

}

module.exports = config;

Name this file config.js and compile your code

# More about the app
This is just a demo app to show how easy it is to use React Native with IOS. I will perhaps build out the Android version shortly.
